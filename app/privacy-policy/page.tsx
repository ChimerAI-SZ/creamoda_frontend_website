            (“ChimerAI”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), operates a cloud-based AI fashion-design software platform, associated
            websites, mobile applications, APIs, and any related features or communications (collectively, the
            “Services”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal data of all
            individuals (“you”) who access or use the Services anywhere in the world.
          </p>
          <h3>1.2 Agreement to Policy</h3>
          <p>
            By creating an account, accessing, or otherwise using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and
            understood this Privacy Policy and agree to the collection and processing of your personal data as described
            herein. If you disagree with any part of this Policy, please do not use the Services.
          </p>
          <h3>1.3 Relation to Other Terms</h3>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into our Terms of Service. Capitalised terms not defined
            here have the meanings given in the Terms of Service or applicable product-specific terms. A separate Cookie
            Policy may further describe our use of cookies and similar technologies.
          </p>
          <h3>1.4 Definitions</h3>
          <p>
            “Personal data” (or “personal information”) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable
            natural person.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Processing” means any operation performed on personal data, whether automated or not, such as collection,
            storage, use, disclosure, or erasure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anonymous or de-identified data that cannot reasonably identify an individual is not personal data under
            this Policy.
          </p>

          <h2>4 How We Disclose or Share Your Information</h2>
          <p>We do not sell personal data. We disclose it only as described below:</p>
          <h3>4.1 Service Providers</h3>
          <p>
            Trusted vendors under written agreements that require confidentiality and data-protection safeguards,
            including:

          <p>· Public profiles and design listings you choose to publish are visible to all site visitors.</p>
          <p>
            · If you initiate collaboration, selected profile or contact data will be shared with the counterparties
            only as you direct.
          </p>
          <p>· Showcased success stories or testimonials are shared only with prior consent.</p>
          <h3>4.3 Legal & Regulatory Compliance</h3>
          <p>We may disclose personal data when we reasonably believe it is required to:</p>
          <p>· comply with applicable law, court order, or lawful request;</p>
          <p>
            · enforce our Terms, investigate violations, or protect the rights, safety, or property of ChimerAI, our
            users, or the public;
          </p>
          <p>· detect, prevent, or address security or fraud issues.</p>
          <p>Where legally permissible, we will notify you before disclosing your data.</p>
          <h3>4.4 Corporate Transactions</h3>
          <p>
            In the event of a merger, acquisition, spin-off, reorganisation, insolvency, or asset sale, personal data
            may be transferred to the successor entity subject to this Policy (or an equivalent policy). We will provide
            prior notice of any material change in control or use.
          </p>
          <h3>4.5 With Your Consent</h3>
          <p>
            We share personal data for any other purpose only after obtaining your explicit consent. You may withdraw
            that consent at any time.
          </p>
          <h3>4.6 Aggregated / Anonymised Data</h3>
          <p>
            We may publish or share anonymised trend reports (e.g., “42 % of designers favour sustainable fabrics”) or
            model-performance metrics that cannot reasonably identify any individual.
          </p>
          <h2>5 International Data Transfers</h2>
          <p>
            We are headquartered in Singapore but rely on a global cloud infrastructure. Consequently, your personal
            data may be transferred to, stored in, or processed within jurisdictions other than your own, including (but
            not limited to) Singapore, the United States, the European Union, and other countries where our
            service-provider data centres are located.
          </p>
          <p>
            · Adequate protection. We will take appropriate safeguards to ensure your personal data receives a level of
            protection that is substantially comparable to that required under this Policy and applicable law.
          </p>
          <p>
            · EEA/UK/Swiss users. When we transfer personal data outside the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, we rely on
            Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission (or the UK Addendum) and, where
            needed, supplementary measures (encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, etc.).
          </p>
          <p>
            · Singapore users. By providing personal data, you consent under the PDPA to its transfer overseas. We will
            ensure that overseas recipients are bound by legally enforceable obligations to protect the data to
            standards comparable to the PDPA.
          </p>
          <p>
            · Other regions. By accessing the Services from any location, you consent to the transfer and processing of
            your information in Singapore and any other country in which we or our subprocessors operate, understanding
            that local laws may differ.
          </p>
          <h2>6 Data Security</h2>
          <p>
            We maintain a comprehensive information-security programme designed to protect personal data against
            accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure, or access:
          </p>
          <p>
            · Technical controls - TLS/HTTPS encryption in transit, AES-256 or equivalent encryption at rest, network
            firewalls, intrusion-detection monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and least-privilege API keys.
          </p>
          <p>
            · Organisational controls - role-based staff access, background checks for employees with elevated
            privileges, mandatory security and privacy training, and incident-response playbooks.
          </p>
          <p>· Testing & audits - regular penetration tests and third-party security assessments.</p>
          <p>
            No absolute guarantee. Despite our efforts, no transmission or storage system is completely secure. You are
            responsible for safeguarding your password, enabling multi-factor authentication where available, and
            promptly notifying us at security@chimerai.com of any suspected account compromise.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we discover a personal-data breach that is likely to result in significant harm or risk to you, we will
            notify affected users and, where required, regulators without undue delay.
