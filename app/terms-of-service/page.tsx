          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

          <h3>1.1 Purpose of Agreement</h3>
          <p>
            These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) constitute a legally binding agreement between ChimerAI Pte. Ltd., a
            company incorporated in Singapore with its principal place of business at [address] (“ChimerAI”, “we”, “us”,
            or “our”), and any individual or entity that accesses or uses our website, applications, APIs, or any
            related products and services (collectively, the “Services”).
          </p>
          <p>
            By creating an account, accessing, or using any part of the Services, you acknowledge that you have read,

            We may revise these Terms from time to time. Material changes will take effect (i) on the date indicated at
            the top of this page, and (ii) after we provide reasonable notice (e-mail, in-app message, or prominent site
            notice). Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of any revision constitutes your
            acceptance of the amended Terms.

            Accounts registered or used in violation of this section are subject to immediate suspension or termination.
          </p>
          <h3>1.4 Definitions</h3>
          <p>For clarity, in these Terms:</p>

          <p>
            · “User Content” means any data, designs, images, text, prompts, or other material uploaded to or generated
            through the Services by a user.
          </p>

            · “Free User” means a user on a non-paid tier; “Paid User” means a user on a subscription or other paid
            plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            · “B2B User” means an entity or individual using the Services primarily for wholesale, manufacturing, or
            other commercial purposes; “Consumer User” means an individual using the Services for personal or

          <h2>2. Account Registration and Security</h2>
          <h3>2.1 Account Creation</h3>
          <p>To access most features you must create an Account. When registering, you agree to:</p>
          <p>
            · provide true, accurate, current, and complete information (including a valid e-mail address and, for B2B
            Users, correct business details);
          </p>
          <p>· keep such information up to date; and</p>
          <p>· maintain only one Account per individual or legal entity unless we expressly approve otherwise.</p>
          <p>
            You may register directly with an e-mail/password or via an approved third-party single-sign-on service
            (e.g., Google OAuth). By selecting a third-party login option, you authorise us to obtain the information
            that provider makes available to us (such as your name and e-mail) in accordance with their terms and
            privacy policies; you remain responsible for that provider’s fees and your compliance with their rules.
          </p>
          <h3>2.2 Account Credentials & Security</h3>
          <p>
            You are solely responsible for safeguarding your login credentials and for all activities that occur under
            your Account. You agree to:
          </p>
          <p>· choose a strong, unique password and keep it confidential;</p>
          <p>· use multi-factor authentication if we make it available;</p>
          <p>· notify us immediately at [security@chimerai.com] of any unauthorised use or security breach; and</p>
          <p>· log out at the end of each session on shared devices.</p>
          <p>We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with these obligations.</p>
          <h3>2.3 Account Usage & Restrictions</h3>
          <p>You agree not to:</p>
          <p>· impersonate any person or entity or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity;</p>
          <p>· register an Account using someone else’s e-mail or a disposable/temporary address;</p>
          <p>· share, transfer, or sublicense your Account without our prior written consent;</p>
          <p>· circumvent or attempt to circumvent any usage limits or security measures; or</p>
          <p>· use another user’s credentials without permission.</p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any Account that violates these Terms or poses a risk to the
            security, integrity, or reputation of the Services.
          </p>
          <h3>2.4 Third-Party Accounts & Integrations</h3>
          <p>
            Certain features may enable you to link or integrate the Services with third-party platforms (e.g., social
            networks, cloud storage, or payment gateways). Your use of any third-party service is subject to that
            provider’s separate terms and privacy practices. We are not liable for acts or omissions of such providers.
            If you authorise a third-party integration, you grant us permission to process, store, and transmit
            information received from or sent to that provider as necessary to provide the requested functionality, all
            in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <h2>3. Scope of Services</h2>
          <h3>3.1 Service Description</h3>
          <p>
            ChimerAI provides a cloud-based, AI-powered software-as-a-service platform that enables users to (i)
            generate and edit fashion designs, (ii) receive styling recommendations, (iii) create virtual photoshoots
            and product imagery, (iv) perform image- or text-based searches for design inspiration or market references,
            and (v) display or share designs for potential wholesale collaboration with third-party buyers
            (collectively, the “Services”). The Services are delivered solely via our web and/or mobile applications. We
            do not manufacture, stock, or sell physical garments, nor do we act as a retailer to consumer end-users. Any
            physical production or sale of goods that may result from use of the Services occurs independently of
            ChimerAI and is governed by separate agreements between the relevant parties.
          </p>
          <h3>3.2 Licence to Use the Services</h3>
          <p>
            Subject to continued compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive,
            non-transferable, and non-sublicensable licence to access and use the Services for your internal business or
            personal purposes. No other rights are granted. All software, algorithms, AI models, user interface
            elements, databases, and other materials comprising the Services are and remain the sole property of
            ChimerAI or its licensors. You obtain no ownership interest in the Services, and all rights not expressly
            granted are reserved.
          </p>
          <h3>3.3 Plans: Free vs Paid</h3>
          <p>
            The Services are offered under multiple plans: a Free Tier and one or more paid Subscription Tiers
            (collectively, “Plans”). Plan features, usage limits, and fees are described on our order pages or
            in-product purchase flows and are incorporated herein by reference. Free Tier accounts may include feature
            restrictions, watermarked or lower-resolution outputs, rate limits, or other functional limits. Content
            ownership differs by Plan as detailed in Section 4. All Subscription Tiers are subject to the fees, billing
            cycles, and cancellation terms set out in Section 10 (Fees & Payments).
          </p>
          <h3>3.4 Service Modifications</h3>
          <p>
            We may enhance, modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services at any time for any reason. Where a
            change materially diminishes core functionality, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
            advance notice (e.g., e-mail, in-app banner). Your sole remedy for dissatisfaction with any modification is
            to cease using the affected feature or to terminate your account in accordance with Section 11
            (Termination).
          </p>
          <h2>4. User Content and Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
          <h3>4.1 Definition of User Content</h3>
          <p>
            “User Content” means any data, text, images, designs, sketches, prompts, feedback, or other material that
            you upload to, input into, or generate through the Services—including all AI-generated outputs derived from
            your prompts or source material.
          </p>
          <h3>4.2 Free Tier – Assignment of Rights</h3>
          <p>
            If you use the Free Tier, you hereby irrevocably assign to ChimerAI all rights, title, and interest
            (including copyright and all neighbouring rights) in and to any User Content you create or upload while on
            the Free Tier. ChimerAI may use, reproduce, adapt, publish, sublicense, and commercialise such content for
            any purpose without further notice or compensation.
          </p>
          <h3>4.3 Subscription Tiers – Ownership and Limited Licence</h3>
          <p>
            If you maintain an active, fully-paid Subscription Tier, you retain all intellectual-property rights in User
            Content you create or upload during that subscription. You grant ChimerAI and its service providers a
            world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive licence to host, store, back-up, process, display, and transmit your
            User Content solely (i) to provide, maintain, and improve the Services, (ii) to comply with law or enforce
            these Terms, and (iii) as you otherwise authorise in writing. ChimerAI will not externally market, sell, or
            publicly display Subscription-tier content without your express consent.
          </p>
          <h3>4.4 Licence Scope for All Users</h3>
          <p>
            The licence you grant under Section 4.2 or 4.3 includes the right for ChimerAI to make derivative works,
            perform automated analysis, and allow subprocessors under written confidentiality obligations to act on our
            behalf. For Free-tier content, the licence (or assignment) is perpetual, irrevocable, and transferable; for
            Subscription-tier content, the licence is co-terminous with your account and survives only for archival,
            security, legal, or backup purposes as set out in our Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <h3>4.5 Moral Rights Waiver</h3>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar
            rights you may have in your User Content (e.g., rights of attribution or integrity).
          </p>
          <h3>4.6 User Warranties</h3>
          <p>You represent and warrant that:</p>
          <p>· (a) you own or have secured all necessary rights in your User Content;</p>
          <p>
            · (b) your User Content does not and will not infringe, misappropriate, or violate any third-party rights,
            including IP, privacy, or publicity rights; and
          </p>
          <p>· (c) your User Content complies with these Terms and all applicable laws.</p>
          <h3>4.7 Monitoring, Takedown & DMCA</h3>
          <p>
            We are not obliged to pre-screen User Content but reserve the right to review, remove, or disable access to
            any content that we reasonably believe violates these Terms or law. If you believe content hosted on the
            Services infringes your copyright, you may submit a notice pursuant to our Copyright Policy (DMCA-equivalent
            procedure), available at [link].
          </p>
          <h3>4.8 Feedback</h3>
          <p>
            Any ideas, suggestions, or feedback you provide regarding the Services are deemed non-confidential and you
            grant ChimerAI a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free right to use and exploit them without restriction or
            compensation.
          </p>

          </p>
          <h2>6. B2B Wholesale Collaboration Terms</h2>
          <h3>6.1 Platform Role</h3>
          <p>
            ChimerAI acts solely as a neutral venue and technology provider enabling designers or other content creators
            (“Sellers”) to present design assets and enabling business purchasers such as brands, manufacturers, or
            retailers (“Buyers”) to discover those assets and initiate contact. ChimerAI is not a party to, and bears no
            agency, brokerage, guaranty, or fiduciary obligations in respect of, any negotiation, contract, or
            transaction that may ensue between Sellers and Buyers.
          </p>
          <h3>6.2 No Consumer Transactions</h3>
          <p>
            The Services target professional, wholesale collaboration only. Consumer-facing retail or direct-to-consumer
            sales are outside the scope of the Services. Accordingly, mandatory consumer-protection rules on returns,
            cooling-off periods, or product-safety disclosures that apply to B2C e-commerce do not govern interactions
            on the Platform.
          </p>
          <h3>6.3 Business User Responsibilities</h3>
          <p>
            · Authenticity & Rights — Sellers must list only original or properly licensed works and must honour any
            representations regarding exclusivity, licensing scope, or delivery lead-times.
          </p>
          <p>
            · Good-Faith Dealings — Buyers must solicit designs, quotations, or samples only with genuine commercial
            interest and must observe agreed payment and delivery terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            · Compliance — All parties are responsible for compliance with export-control, customs, labelling, and other
            trade laws that may apply to their products or transactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            ChimerAI may suspend or remove any Account reported for plagiarism, non-payment, or other unprofessional
            conduct, but does not adjudicate contractual disputes.
          </p>
          <h3>6.4 No Guarantees or Endorsements</h3>
          <p>
            The Platform does not verify the accuracy of listings, the financial standing of Users, or the existence or
            quality of the goods ultimately manufactured. Listings, user profiles, and catalogues are provided “as-is”
            without endorsement.
          </p>
          <h3>6.5 Independent Contracts</h3>
          <p>
            If a Seller and Buyer choose to conclude a wholesale agreement, they must independently negotiate and
            execute a binding contract covering price, quantity, intellectual-property ownership or licensing, quality
            control, delivery, warranties, and any other commercial terms they deem necessary. ChimerAI shall not draft,
            store, or enforce such agreements and assumes no liability arising from them.
          </p>
          <h3>6.6 Platform Fees (if applicable)</h3>
          <p>Where stated on our order pages or a separate fee schedule, ChimerAI may charge:</p>
          <p>· Subscription Fees for access to wholesale-collaboration tools; and/or</p>
          <p>
            · Transaction Commissions (e.g., X% of the first order value) payable by Sellers when an off-platform deal
            results directly from a Platform introduction.
          </p>
          <p>
            All such fees are remuneration for the facilitation service only and do not render ChimerAI a party to any
            sale.
          </p>
          <h3>6.7 Confidentiality</h3>
          <p>
            Private messages, briefs, or design files exchanged between Buyers and Sellers via in-platform collaboration
            tools are considered confidential between those users. ChimerAI personnel will access such content only
            where necessary for technical support, safety, or legal compliance and will not disclose it to third parties
            without lawful basis or the affected users’ consent. Users remain responsible for employing additional NDAs
            off-platform where heightened confidentiality is required.
          </p>
          <h2>7. Fees, Payments & Refunds</h2>
          <h3>7.1 Subscription Plans</h3>
          <p>
            Paid access is offered on Monthly and Annual Plans (plan details, current pricing, and feature matrices
            appear on the order page and are hereby incorporated). By subscribing, you authorise ChimerAI to charge the
            stated fees and any applicable taxes to your chosen payment method.
          </p>
          <h3>7.2 Payment Processing & Data Security</h3>
          <p>
            All payments are processed through PCI-DSS-compliant third-party processors. We receive only a
            payment-token, card type, expiry, and the last four digits for reconciliation; we do not store full card
            numbers.
          </p>
          <h3>7.3 Billing Cycle & Auto-Renewal</h3>
          <p>
            Subscriptions auto-renew on the first day of each new billing period (monthly or annually, depending on your
            selection) until cancelled via Account → Billing settings or by e-mailing billing@chimerai.com at least one
            business day before renewal.
          </p>
          <h3>7.4 Upgrades & Downgrades</h3>
          <p>
            Plan upgrades take effect immediately; we will charge a prorated fee for the remainder of the current cycle.
            Downgrades take effect at the next renewal to avoid loss of premium features mid-cycle.
          </p>
          <h3>7.5 No Refunds</h3>
          <p>
            All payments are final and non-refundable, except (i) where a statutory cooling-off period is mandatory, or
            (ii) we confirm a billing error in writing. Early cancellation or Account termination for breach does not
            entitle you to any refund of prepaid fees.
          </p>
          <h3>7.6 Late Payments & Taxes</h3>
          <p>
            Prices are exclusive of applicable sales, VAT/GST, or other taxes, which will be added and collected where
            required. Failed charges may result in suspension of paid features, and we reserve the right to levy
            statutory interest or recovery costs on overdue amounts.
          </p>
          <h3>7.7 Changes to Fees</h3>
          <p>
            We may revise pricing or introduce new fees with at least 30 days’ notice by e-mail or in-product message.
            If you disagree, you may cancel before the new fees apply; continued use constitutes acceptance.
          </p>

            (including lost profits, loss of goodwill, lost data, loss of business opportunities, or procurement of
            substitute services) arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the use or inability to use the
            Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
          </p>
          <h3>10.2 Aggregate Liability Cap</h3>
          <p>
            To the extent any liability is not lawfully excluded under Section 10.1, the aggregate liability of ChimerAI
            and its affiliates for all claims arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms shall not exceed
            the greater of:
          </p>
          <p>
            · (a) the total fees actually paid by you to ChimerAI for the Services in the twelve (12) months immediately
            preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or
          </p>
          <p>· (b) USD $100 (or the equivalent in your local currency if conversion is required).</p>
          <h3>10.3 Non-Excludable Liability</h3>
          <p>
            Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes liability for (i) death or personal injury caused by proven gross
            negligence, (ii) wilful misconduct or fraud, or (iii) any liability that cannot lawfully be limited under
            applicable law. Certain jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages; in such
            jurisdictions our liability is limited to the minimum extent permitted by law.
          </p>
          <h3>10.4 User Responsibility</h3>
          <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that you assume full responsibility for any loss or damage that results from your

            losses, damages, judgments, awards, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out
            of or relating to:
          </p>

          <p>· (b) your misuse of the Services or violation of law;</p>
          <p>

            We employ commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and organisational safeguards to protect
            personal data against unauthorised access, loss, or alteration. No system is infallible, and you acknowledge
            the inherent security risks of transmitting information over the internet. You are responsible for
            maintaining the confidentiality of your Account credentials and for promptly notifying us of any suspected
            breach.

            accessed or disclosed by ChimerAI (i) to provide, maintain, or improve the Services, (ii) to comply with
            applicable law or lawful requests, (iii) to enforce these Terms, or (iv) with your consent. Our employees

            do so only to the extent required and, where legally permissible, will notify the affected user.

          <h2>13. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
          <h3>13.1 External Links</h3>
          <p>
            The Services may contain links to third-party websites, applications, or resources (collectively, “External
            Resources”) that are provided solely for your convenience. ChimerAI does not control, endorse, or assume any
            responsibility for the availability, content, privacy policies, or practices of External Resources.
            Accessing or using an External Resource is entirely at your own risk, and you are responsible for reviewing
            and complying with that resource’s terms and policies.
          </p>
          <h3>13.2 Third-Party Software / Components</h3>
          <p>
            The Services incorporate or interoperate with certain third-party software libraries, SDKs, and APIs (for
            example, image-processing engines, OAuth modules, font files). Such components are licensed under their own
            terms, which you agree to follow. ChimerAI disclaims any liability arising out of those components or your
            non-compliance with the applicable third-party licences.
          </p>
          <h3>13.3 User API Access</h3>

          <p>· (b) respect any published rate limits and usage documentation;</p>
          <p>
            · (c) refrain from caching, selling, or distributing data obtained via the API except as expressly
            permitted; and
          </p>
          <p>· (d) keep your API keys confidential and immediately notify us of any compromise.</p>
          <p>We may monitor, suspend, or revoke API access for abuse or security concerns.</p>
          <h3>13.4 Connected Third-Party Accounts</h3>
          <p>
            If you voluntarily link your Account to an external service (e.g., Google Drive import), you authorise us to
            access and process content from that service solely as necessary to provide the requested functionality.
            Your relationship with the external service provider is independent of ChimerAI, and any disputes or
            data-use issues must be resolved with that provider.
          </p>
          <h3>13.5 No Liability for Third-Party Acts</h3>
          <p>
            Any dealings between you and a third-party provider— including payments, delivery of goods, or provision of

            you may have against a third party.

            “Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, including the validity,
            breach, or termination thereof, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the
            Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) under the SIAC Rules in force when the Notice of
            Arbitration is submitted. The seat of arbitration shall be Singapore, the language shall be English, and

          </p>
          <h3>14.4 Local Law Compliance</h3>

            herein deprives you of any mandatory consumer rights that cannot legally be waived.

          <p>
            Failure or delay by ChimerAI to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver
            of future enforcement of that right or provision.
          </p>
          <h3>15.4 Assignment</h3>
          <p>
            You may not assign, delegate, or transfer these Terms (or any rights or obligations hereunder) without

            affiliate, (ii) in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganisation, or sale of all or
            substantially all of its assets, or (iii) by operation of law, with notice to you.
